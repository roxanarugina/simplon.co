The topic became [...] known as "computer science" —which, actually is like referring to surgery as "knife science" - Edsger W. Dijkstra

Computer science is a terrible name for this business.  First of all, it's not a science. It might be engineering or it might be art, but we'll actually
see that computer so-called science actually has a lot in common with magic" -  Gerald Jay Sussman

Actually, that First of all, it see that computer so-called science actually has a lot in common with magic - Gerald Jay Sussman

Now, the reason that we think computer science is about computers is pretty much the same reason that the Egyptians thought geometry was about surveying instruments. And that is, when some field is just getting started and you don't really understand it very well, it's very easy to confuse the essence of what you're doing with the tools that you use. And indeed, on some absolute scale of things, we probably know less about the essence of computer science than the ancient Egyptians really knew about geometry. - Gerald Jay Sussman

I think in the future people will look back and say, yes, those primitives in the 20th century were fiddling around with these gadgets called computers, but really what they were doing is starting to learn how to formalize intuitions about process, how to do things, starting to develop a way to talk precisely about how-to knowledge, as opposed to geometry that talks about what is true. - Gerald Jay Sussman

The real romance is out ahead and yet to come. The computer revolution hasn't started yet. Don't be misled by the enormous flow of money into bad defacto standards for unsophisticated buyers using poor adaptations of incomplete ideas. - Alan Kay

[Computing] is just a fabulous place for that, because it's a place where you don't have to be a Ph.D. or anything else. It's a place where you can still be an artisan. People are willing to pay you if you're any good at all, and you have plenty of time for screwing around. - Alan Kay (1972)

What I cannot build, I do not understand. - Richard Feynman

In programming the hard part isn’t solving problems, but deciding what problems to solve. - Paul Graham

Ruby is simple in appearance, but is very complex inside, just like our human body. --matz.

Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute. - Abelson and Sussman

My conscience won’t let me call Ruby a computer language. That would imply that the language works primarily on the computer’s terms. That the language is designed to accommodate the computer, first and foremost. That therefore, we, the coders, are foreigners, seeking citizenship in the computer’s locale. It’s the computer’s language and we are translators for the world.
But what do you call the language when your brain begins to think in that language? When you start to use the language’s own words and colloquialisms to express yourself. Say, the computer can’t do that. How can it be the computer’s language? It is ours, we speak it natively!
We can no longer truthfully call it a computer language. It is coderspeak. It is the language of our thoughts. - \_why the lucky stiff
